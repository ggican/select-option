- `withSearch`: Enables search functionality within the Select component.
- `portalId`: Enables portalId functionality within the Select component.
- `multiple`: Allows multiple selections.
- `optionLabel`: Defines the label for the options.
- `options`: An array of objects representing selectable options.

### Example

```jsx
export const Default = () => <Select  
    name="input" 
    type="text" 
    optionLabel="label" 
    placeholder="Dropdown Form" 
    size="md" 
    options={[]}  
/>;
```

### Description

The `SelectO` Story demonstrates a customized `Select` component from your library with enhanced filtering capabilities based on user input. Key features include:

- **Custom Filter Functionality:** The `filterOption` prop is used to customize how options are filtered based on user input.
- **Multiple Selection:** Enables users to select multiple options simultaneously (`multiple: true`).
- **Search Functionality:** Includes a search input within the Select component (`withSearch: true`) for easy option discovery.
- **Example Options:** Displays a set of example options with varying lengths and labels for testing the filtering functionality.

This repo is useful for scenarios where you need a Select component with advanced filtering and multi-selection capabilities, tailored to fit specific user interaction patterns in your application.
